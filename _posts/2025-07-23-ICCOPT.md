I presented a talk titled "Leveraging Automatic Differentiation to Improve Ice-Sheet and Ocean Modeling" in <a href="https://iccopt2025usc.sched.com/event/e09f2487e52020a1f8483dc4cec045fc">ICCOPT VIII</a> held in University of Southern California (USC). Fun fact: I bantered with an Aussie about the upcoming Ashes and later found out he was none other than <a href="https://wrightstephen.github.io/sw_proj/">Stephen Wright</a>! His book on Numerical Optimization along with Jorge Nocedal is world-renowned.
